# REUNITE -MISSING CHILDREN TRACKING APP

The growing incidents of missing children are a cause of concern. Child trafficking and abduction are major factors that lead to missing cases. A large number of child trafficking victims are very young. As time passes, their faces may appear to be quite different from the photos provided by their parents or relatives, and many times the face images are obstructed or blurry. This causes a need to create a system which will help find the lost children through the child face aging mechanism where only limited data such as a picture (childhood picture) is available.

The proposed system will help families find their lost or missing children by uploading their pictures and providing their information through the app. Using Face Aging Generative adversarial networks (GAN) the childhood image will be reconstructed to resemble the child's face at the present time. Additionally, users will be notified if a child goes missing in their locality or area.
